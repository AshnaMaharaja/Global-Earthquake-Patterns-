# Global-Earthquake-Patterns
Global Earthquake Patterns: In this project I used 30 days of earthquake data to create a simple dashboard. It includes a world map showing earthquake locations and magnitudes, a list of the top 10 strongest earthquakes, and the percentage of earthquakes in each main region. It also shows, for each smaller location, how many earthquakes happened and their average and maximum magnitudes. Everything is connected to one date filter so we can see changes day by day.(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashna.m4135/viz/Book1_17501844028490/GlobalEarthquakeTracker?publish=yes )
