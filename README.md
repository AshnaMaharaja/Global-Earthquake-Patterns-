# Global-Earthquake-Patterns

PROJECT OVERVIEW :

Global Earthquake Patterns: In this project I used 30 days of earthquake data to create a simple dashboard. It includes a world map showing earthquake locations and magnitudes, a list of the top 10 strongest earthquakes, and the percentage of earthquakes in each main region. It also shows, for each smaller location, how many earthquakes happened and their average and maximum magnitudes. Everything is connected to one date filter so we can see changes day by day.(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashna.m4135/viz/Book1_17501844028490/GlobalEarthquakeTracker?publish=yes )

DATA OVERVIEW:
This dataset provides an overview of global earthquake events, including the date, time, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), magnitude, and geographical classification (specific location and broader region). Each record represents an individual earthquake, with unique IDs and timestamps. The dataset can be used to visualize earthquake patterns on a map, identify the strongest events, analyze regional distributions, and calculate average and maximum magnitudes by location. Notably, one magnitude value (36) appears to be an outlier and may require further validation or cleaning.
